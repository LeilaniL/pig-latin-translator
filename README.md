# Pig Latin Translator
###### by Alex Williams and Leilani Leach

### Description
###### This form lets the user input a sentence and see it translated to Pig Latin. It uses regular expressions and switch statements to do so.

###### Here are the rules of Pig Latin:

###### For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

###### For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

###### If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

###### For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant
